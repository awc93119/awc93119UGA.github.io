				<p> Over the course of the year the Bulldogs remained at the #2 spot on most College football
						ranking, even though suffering a 40-17 loss to #10 SEC rival Auburn in week 8. The Dawgs
						redeemed themselves by stomping the Auburn Tigers in the SEC Championship 28-7, which allowed
						them to proceed into the newly adopted College Football Playoff Bracket with the top 4 teams 
						in the country. Barely passing Oklahoma in the Rose Bowl, UGA had their eyes on their foes to
						the West. The Alabama was a nail-biting spectacle, unfortunately UGA suffered a last-minute
						score to lose the game 26-23 in Overtime. If this season was any indication of the future of this 
						program in the next five years, we should expect a National Championship Trophy coming to Athens VERY soon.<img src="Pup.html" alt= "UGA VI" align="right"></p>
