		<H3>Who's That Coming  the Street?</h3>
		<p> With one legacy ending and another beginning, The University of Georgia released their 
		Head Football Coach of 15 years, Mark Richt. As a fan base, we all loved and endured his legacy
		but it was time for a smart change. Beginning in the 2016-2017 season, UGA signed The University
		of Alabama’s Defensive Coordinator, Kirby Smart, to a six-year deal. This is exactly what the 
		Bulldogs needed for the future of the program, the new coach offered more strenuous, extreme, 
		and necessary measures than the past coach when mentoring and coaching the athletes. To put his commitment 
		into perspective, On his first night as Head Coach, he was already visiting a top prospect, which proved that
		he is ready to take this football program and prosper.</P>
	
	
		<p>His first season as coach was ideal for a first-year coach/team output by going 8-5, but there’s
		always a first step to the stairway to greatness. Georgia followed up the 2016-2017 with a 13-2 
		season that arguably began in December 2016, when Sony Michel, fellow tailback Nick Chubb and 
		outside linebackers Davin Bellamy and Lorenzo Carter announced they would be returning for their 
		senior years. With the season beginning, you can say the major threats to come were from Notre 
		Dame, Mississippi State, South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, Auburn, and whichever bowl games 
		they were striving to attend. Even though opponents such as South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, 
		and Georgia Tech did not oppose any pressuring threat throughout the year due to the pre-ranks, 
		we Georgia fans know that due to the rivalries in history, you can throw rankings out the window.

		<p>With UGA losing some memorable juniors and seniors such as Michel, Chubb, Bellamy, Carter, 
		and Smith; who all shared a vital role for the team in the recent season, there were spots to
		fill. As the new season is rolling around the Georgia Bulldogs continue to sign highly-recruited,
		sought after players. By strictly looking at the class coming into the 2018-2019 season, the Bulldogs
		have 7 5-star recruits, 16 4-star recruits, and 2 3-star players. The quality of UGA's recruits put them
		on the top seat in regard to recruiting class across the nation.Click
